=What's new message platform's feature=
*Message queue facility introduced. By integrating the latest message
queue service inside company, we can deprecate the old DB message
queue and low down the high CPU load.
*Mass-data storage level design. By introducing new hybrid storage
architecture, we can store message payload directly to S3, which is
good at storing massive data and easy to scale. This makes the system
easy to handle peaking data scenario.
*new Status tracking layer. New Status tracking layer inherits a lot from
the old DB message table schema. However, this time, status tracking
layer is not a queue for high frequency selection. Status tracking
layer mainly maintains the status of messages flowing inside platform,
and publish more user friendly metrics to outside world, for monitor and operation
purpose. 
*AWS targeted. The platform is designed and implemented directly on
EC2 platform, which means dropship team can deprecate legacy
infrastructure for messaging system in the future easily. 
*Service oriented architecture(SOA) design. SOA has become the most
common architecture inside Amazon these days. making service
independently inside dropship can easily give our system more
modularity and boundaries, so problems and issues can be identified
more quickly. Bug fixing/Feature implementation can also benefit from
SOA architecture.New message platform heavily applied Coral service
techniques inside, which makes platform a more SOA based platform.
